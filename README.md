# Applications of Artificial Intelligence 
## Summary

Flight delays have become a significant problem in the airline industry, causing financial losses and customer dissatisfaction. The costs of delays have increased in recent years, and the COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the situation. The aim of this project is to use Machine Learning algorithms to assess the potential for predicting flight delays and identifying areas of improvement. By developing predictive models, we hope to monitor and reduce airline delays, enhancing efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## Detailed Approach
## Understanding the Dataset

The dataset contains essential information about flight incidents, including date, time, carrier, airports, and delay details. Initially, we had 37 columns, and to simplify the data representation, we combined date and time information into more informative features. Out of the 37 columns, we identified 10 columns with object types, and to visualize the data effectively, we focused on numerical values for analysis.

## Data Visualization and Analysis

We began the analysis by plotting bar graphs for certain features, aiming to understand the average percentage of flights delayed more than 15 minutes. The initial visualization provided insights into the overall flight delay trends. Notably, flight delays were more prevalent in extreme temperature months such as June, July, and December. Additionally, Thursdays and Fridays showed higher flight delays compared to Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

Further analysis involved plotting bar graphs with arrival time blocks and airlines to determine the percentage of flights delayed more than 15 minutes. The data showed that flights arriving between dawn to dusk (nighttime) experienced higher delays, particularly for flights arriving between 11 PM to 6 AM. Arrival delays also increased after 5 PM, indicating potential factors affecting the delays.

## Next Steps: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The next step in the project is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), where we will delve deeper into the data to gain more insights and identify patterns. EDA will involve feature engineering, data preprocessing, and additional visualizations to prepare the data for machine learning models.
